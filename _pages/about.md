I'm just a security researcher who interested in Android application security and mobile malware analysis as hobby.

Hobbies:
- cycling : ~100 km per week (as an amateur)
- hot wheels cars : i have about 50-60 of them. I collect only regular series like factory fresh, j-ımports, retro racers...(No, i don't have any STH :/ )
- photography: i havent go to taking photograph with my machine for 1.5 - 2 year but here is my old shots -> [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/farukarslan/)
- and mobile security

If you want to talk about one of this topics with me, message me on twitter :)
